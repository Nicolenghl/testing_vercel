## 1. Main Goal, Problem & Key Issues

### Main Goal
To accelerate the adoption of sustainable food practices by leveraging blockchain technology to reward both restaurants and consumers who make environmentally-friendly choices.

### The Problem
The food industry is responsible for approximately 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but consumers lack transparent information about the environmental impact of their dining choices. Meanwhile, restaurants that invest in sustainable practices often struggle to effectively market their efforts and convert them into business advantages.

### Key Issues

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Consumers can't easily verify restaurants' sustainability claims
2. **Lack of Incentives**: Limited financial motivation for consumers to choose eco-friendly options
3. **Fragmented Market**: No unified platform connecting green restaurants with conscious consumers
4. **Insufficient Recognition**: Sustainable restaurants have trouble differentiating themselves
5. **Consumer Trust**: Widespread skepticism about green marketing claims
